                              <p>Sharing deep neural networks and testing the performance of trained networks typically involve a major initial commitment towards one algorithm, before knowing how the network will perform on a different dataset. The major purpose for developng a DL based segmentation tool is to allow immediate access to experiment with AI for image segmentation and the ability to test different trained models near-instantaneously.
                              The model is pretrained on segmentation tasks for electron microscopy, X-ray microCT and light microscopy data. Through intensive analysis of SBEM and EM data, we were able to track and reconstruct subcellular organelles within neurons, especially focused on interactions between ER and mitochondria. Collectively, our results on the analysis of ER presence and networks within a neuron advances our knowledge on the structural interpretation of organization and interactions of ER in neurons and its significance in cell physiology.</p>

                         <p><b>DL-based image segmentation tool.</b> (a)Automatic Segmentation of Organelles in EM Image Stacks All images obtained from SBEM are first converted and appended to an 8-bit MRC stack using IMOD. The sequential images are then aligned in the XY plane. By matching the histograms of the image stack to the first image, the consistency of the stack is maintained (Coltucetal.,2006). After selecting an organelle of interest, a set of organelle-specific images are generated to train a CHM pixel classifier. Such training tiles are extracted from a set of seed points throughout the image stack. When all training images are collected, CHM pixel classifier is trained through numerous bottom-up and top-down steps. The collected data are then combined into a single classifier adjusted to natural resolution. Then, a probability map is generated from previously obtained test set and goes through binarization. The binarized outputs are converted to MRC format and the contours are meshed together to generate a 3D model.

                              <p> With the capsid, the viral protein shell, viruses conceal their genetic material and can slip inside the host's body (like a Trojan horse!). The goal of the project was to create an applicable structural model of the proteins that compose the capsid to better understand the viral life cycle and infection mechanism.
                              In order to streamline the process, an importer function to read the protein data from the protein databank (RCSB PDB) was developed. The closeness of the obtained idealized tilings to the structures of considered capsids shows that the proposed approach is general for many structures of small and medium-sized viruses. Such tilings provides a general idea about quasi-equivalence of proteins, thus simplify the internal structure of protein molecules and viral genome. Our model provides a better insight into the protein structures of viral capsid, enabling a further research on virus models that do not comply to the conventional Caspar-and-Klug model. </p>

Although the connectivity of axons are crucial in signal transfer between neurons, its structural assembly and trend across the cortex is yet not widely investigated. By utilizing image processing techniques, we look at the structural trend and are able to quantify axon expressions, providing valuable data for further investigation of neuronal activity.</p>
